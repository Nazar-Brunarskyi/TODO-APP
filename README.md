# DESCRIPTION
this APP is designed to keep a list of things you have to do. You can:
  * add new TODOS
  * delete the old ones
  * edit the TODOS you have in your list
  * toggle their status

the app is connected to the server so you won't lose your list of TODOS after closing the app. You can use your email to registrants on the APP, in this way you can make sure your TODOS are available on other devices.
